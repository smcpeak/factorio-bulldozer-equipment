[equipment-name]
bulldozer-equipment=Bulldozer Equipment


[item-name]
bulldozer-equipment=Bulldozer Equipment

[item-description]
bulldozer-equipment=Automatically marks nearby natural obstacles for removal.  Also provides belt immunity.  NOTE: The landfill function requires you to first put a blueprint with exactly one landfill tile, and nothing else, into the *game* blueprint library.  See mod description for more details.


[recipe-name]
bulldozer-equipment=Bulldozer Equipment


[technology-name]
bulldozer-equipment=Bulldozer Equipment

[technology-description]
bulldozer-equipment=Provides equipment that automatically marks nearby natural obstacles for removal.


[shortcut-name]
bulldozer-equipment=Bulldozer Equipment


[mod-setting-name]
bulldozer-equipment-diagnostic-verbosity=Diagnostic log verbosity
bulldozer-equipment-check-period-ticks=Obstacle check period
bulldozer-equipment-refresh-landfill-blueprint-period-ticks=Blueprint check period
bulldozer-equipment-obstacle-entity-radius=Obstacle entity scan radius
bulldozer-equipment-obstacle-tile-radius=Obstacle tile scan radius
bulldozer-equipment-enable-for-player=Enable for this player

[mod-setting-description]
bulldozer-equipment-diagnostic-verbosity=Adjusts the level of detail logged to factorio-current.log.  0: None, 1: Problems, 2: Occasional events of interest to the user, 3: More frequent user events, 4: Low-frequency developer-only details, 5: High-frequency developer-only details.
bulldozer-equipment-check-period-ticks=Time, in game ticks (1/60 s), between checks for nearby obstacles to clear.  Lower is more responsive but also more CPU-intensive.
bulldozer-equipment-refresh-landfill-blueprint-period-ticks=Time, in game ticks (1/60 s), between checks for a suitable landfill blueprint.  This should not need any adjusting.
bulldozer-equipment-obstacle-entity-radius=Distance in world units to scan for nearby obstacle entities, namely trees, rocks, and cliffs.
bulldozer-equipment-obstacle-tile-radius=Distance in world units to scan for nearby obstacle tiles, principally water.  By default this is smaller than the entity radius because landfilling is more expensive (in both time and materials) than clearing trees, etc.
bulldozer-equipment-enable-for-player=Uncheck to disable the mod for this player's *character*, even with the equipment in the grid.  This does not affect equipment in a vehicle grid, even the vehicle being driven by the player.
