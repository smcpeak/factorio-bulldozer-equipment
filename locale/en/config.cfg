[mod-setting-description]
bulldozer-equipment-call-error-on-bug=If the mod detects a bug in itself, call the error() function, which causes Factorio to halt.  This is only meant for use by developers.
bulldozer-equipment-diagnostic-verbosity=Adjusts the level of detail logged to factorio-current.log.  0: None, 1: Problems, 2: Occasional events of interest to the user, 3: More frequent user events, 4: Low-frequency developer-only details, 5: High-frequency developer-only details.
bulldozer-equipment-obstacle-check-period-ticks=Time, in game ticks (1/60 s), between checks for nearby obstacles to clear.  Lower is more responsive but also more CPU-intensive.  0 disables.
bulldozer-equipment-landfill-creation-period-ticks=Time, in game ticks (1/60 s), between attempts to create one landfill from trees, coal, and stone in the main or trash inventory.  0 disables.
bulldozer-equipment-enable-for-player=When checked, the mod functions for the player character and any vehicles for which the player is the "last user".
bulldozer-equipment-obstacle-entity-radius=Distance in world units to scan for nearby obstacle entities, namely trees, rocks, and cliffs.
bulldozer-equipment-obstacle-tile-radius=Distance in world units to scan for nearby obstacle tiles, principally water.  By default this is smaller than the entity radius because landfilling is more expensive (in both time and materials) than clearing trees, etc.
bulldozer-equipment-want-remove-trees=When checked, remove nearby trees.
bulldozer-equipment-want-remove-rocks=When checked, remove nearby rocks.
bulldozer-equipment-want-remove-cliffs=When checked, and Cliff Explosives has been researched, remove nearby cliffs.
bulldozer-equipment-want-remove-water=When checked, fill nearby water with landfill.
bulldozer-equipment-want-landfill-from-wood=Convert wood in the main or trash inventory into landfill at a cost of 100 wood per landfill, once per landfill creation period (in map settings, default is one second).
bulldozer-equipment-want-landfill-from-coal=Convert coal in the main or trash inventory into landfill at a cost of 50 coal per landfill, once per landfill creation period (in map settings, default is one second).
bulldozer-equipment-want-landfill-from-stone=Convert stone in the main or trash inventory into landfill at a cost of 50 stone per landfill, once per landfill creation period (in map settings, default is one second).
