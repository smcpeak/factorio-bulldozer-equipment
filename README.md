Introduction
============

BulldozerEquipment is a mod for [Factorio](https://wiki.factorio.com/).
It adds an equipment component that automatically orders the
deconstruction of all nearby trees, rocks, and cliffs, and orders nearby
water to be filled with landfill.

The primary intended use case is to equip the lead tanks of a
[RoboTank](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RoboTank) formation with the
equipment so that they will order a path to be cleared.  The robots that
do the actual clearing can be carried by the player, the RoboTanks, or
both.  It allows the formation to roll though virtually any obstacle,
provided it has enough resources (cliff explosives and landfill), free
space to store the trash, and armor and armament to deal with hostiles.

It is also useful out of combat, conveniently clearing obstacles and
providing buildable space otherwise blocked by water.
